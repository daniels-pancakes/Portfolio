        <!-- The title of my page contains a fairly obscure reference to a video game series that I would be shocked if anyone caught. Video games are a huge inspiration for me creatively and I wanted to channel some of what I love into this project since I feel a portfolio is a chance to express myself.

        In particular I drew inspiration from some of the incredible user interface design work from a handful of games I thought had really incredible aesthetics.

        But I love these somewhat strange-sounding yet somewhat profound one-off lines sometimes encountered in video games and related media. I'll probably drop a few here and there for fun. -->
